Changelog RFC v.2

- Fixed SD card reader
- Processed raw data manually (deleted adafruit BMP390 library with presets)
- Removed Yaw 
- Optimized for Arduino Nano

Split into two files; FCR-2 is optimized for the limited resources of a Nano Microcontroller and FCR-1 is optimized for a full ardiuno board.
FCR-2 is the only Flight Computer that has flown!

Flight Results:

Failure. Breadboard disconnect - MISO pin failure on SD card reader. Codebase optimized for launch, however, physical design changes are required.
